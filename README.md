# Project-1
The code is a quiz game where the user is given a choice of three categories and is asked a question from that category.
The questions, categories and answers are stored in a CSV file. 
The code consists of functions that read the CSV file and store the data in a list. 
The code also has functions that randomly select 9 questions from the 3 chosen categories, display the questions on the board, and keep track of used questions. 
The code returns false when there are no more unused questions.
